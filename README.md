# Prediction-of-Parkinson-disease

This is a PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS project done by the students pursuing 2nd year MSc. Data Science in PSG College of Technology.

Our work is based on Parkinson's disease prediction.

And our objective is to classify subjects into either healthy or parkinsonian classes using various classification methods such as K-NN ( K nearest neighbours) , K means , SVM (support vector machines) , random forest and decision tree algorithms .

We have attatched the links to the google colaboratory(Python) codes for all the above algorithms.

And we have also added a powerpoint presentation for our work.

THANK YOU....!!!!
